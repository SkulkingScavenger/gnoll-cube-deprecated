Gold Distribution System

Between 25$ and 50% of total Gold is stored in treasure chests

G = total gold amount for the dungeon
T = treasure (between G/4 and G/2)
C = loose money (G - T)
n = room_count

Coin Distribution
Coins should be distributed as a bell curve
example distribution:

for n = 10:
average = 100%/n = 10%
increment = 10%/(n/2)

room1:	2%
room2:	4%
room3:	6%
room4:	8%
room5:	10%

room6:	10%
room7:	12%
room8:	14%
room9:	16%
room10:	18%

if (n is even){
	for(i=0;i<n/2;i+=1){
		l_add(average - i*increment);
		l_add(average + i*increment);
	}
}else{
	for(i=1;i<(n+1)/2;i+=1){
		l_add(average - i*increment);
		l_add(average + i*increment);
	}
	l_add(average);
}
total = 0;
for(i=0;i<n;i+=1){
	total += l_get(i);
}
//if there's a problem assign the difference to a random chamber
difference = coins - total;
if (difference > 0){
	num = random(chamber_count);
	l_replace(num,l_get(num)+difference);
}

Once you have the list of gold amounts, assign each chamber its amount
1. create a list of all rooms
2. for each gold amount,
	2a. generate a random number "num" between zero and chamber_count
	2b. pop the chamber at num
	2c. assign the amount to that room

This is the hard part, since we have to now place the gold at different locations.
We assume gold isn't just lying around on the floor. 
It should either be hidden in destructible doodads or enemies
so for each room, get the list of all possible storage units
further randomize among these.

take the total number of coins in that room.
while (total >= coin_max){
	var num = random(coin_max);
	if (num < coin_min){
		num = coin_min;
	}
	l_add(num);
	total -= num;
}
l_add(total);

take the total stash locations
assign amounts to random stash locations

Problem: what if there are more gold amounts than stash locations?
Insure that total/min < stash_locations.
how? min = ceil(total/stash_count)
ideally, min should be one, there should be 


Treasure:

1. divide treasure amount into small chests.
2. determine how many of each higher denomination chests appear
small chest = 1 chest		55% of total chests
medium chest = 2 chests	34% of total chests
large chest = 3 chests	10% of total chests
super chest = 4 chests	1% of total chests

45% chance to be a small chest
35% chance to be included in a medium chest or smaller
15% chance to be included in a large chest or smaller
5% chance to be included in a super chest or lower



given 10 chests:

probably 4.5 are small
probably 3.5 are medium
probably 1.5 are large
probably .5 are super large

0.5 div 4 = 0 super
0.5 mod 4 = 0.5
0.5 + 1.5 = 2
2 div 3 = 0 large
2 mod 3 = 2
2 + 3.5 = 5.5
5.5 div 2 = 2 medium
5.5 mod 2 = 1.5
1.5 + 4.5 = 6 small

this seems like a good ratio. 

Total Gold
	Coins
		Coins per Chamber
	Chests
		small
		medium
		large
		super

create a list of all rooms
for each chest,
	generate a random number "num" between zero and chamber_count
	pop the chamber at num
	put the chest in that room




Example Dungeon:
n = 16
G = 1600
C = 1600*(1/4) = 400
T = 1200

average coins = 400/16 = 25
25 doodads+enemies per room? sounds good

small chest = 100 gold
medium chest = 200 gold
large chest = 300 gold
super chest = 400 gold


PROBLEM:
We don't actually generate things like enemies and doodads until we generate the individual chambers. This is a big problem, because it means we can't make any promises about minimum unit count. forcing chambers to comply with pregenerated restrictions means that we need to do extra work in the level editor to make sure those demands can actually be met,
